# 🚀 Large Scale Computing
This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects exploring scalable computing techniques across distributed systems, parallel processing, and high-dimensional data analysis.

## 📂 Contents

### 1. 🧮 [Laplace Simulation with MPI](https://github.com/wuyaning3288/Large_Scale_Computing/blob/main/laplace_hw1%20(2).py)

Simulated the iterative process of solving the Laplace equation using MPI for parallel computation.  
This exercise demonstrates how message-passing architectures can accelerate numerical methods.

- Language: Python with `mpi4py`
- Topics: Parallel computing, Laplace equation, MPI grid communication

### 2. 🔭 [Mining Astrophysical Signals with Spark](https://github.com/wuyaning3288/Large_Scale_Computing/blob/main/hw3%20(1).py)
Leveraged PySpark to process and mine radio frequency signals in search of pulsar sources.  
This project emulates large-scale signal analysis workflows typical in scientific astronomy.

- Framework: PySpark
- Tasks: Data ingestion, filtering, signal-to-noise analysis
- Goal: Identify the pulsar source with the most signal counts, respecting error tolerances

### 3. 🧊 [High-dimensional Object Detection using PCA & Clustering](https://github.com/wuyaning3288/Large_Scale_Computing/blob/main/hw4_new%20(1).py)
Applied Spark for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis on simulated objects in a 6-dimensional space.  
This work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting structured patterns in ultra-high-dimensional data.

- Methods: PCA, KMeans clustering
- Tools: PySpark MLlib
- Use case: Geometric object reconstruction from projections
